# Technical Details

In general, this website follows the [HTML First paradigm](https://html-first.com), which means that this website does not use a frontend framework like React but is instead statically rendered to HTML using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) static site generator. Additionally, semantic HTML/class-less CSS is used wherever possible. Pre-compressed [Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) files are then served by the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) webserver, running on a [Strato](https://www.strato.de) VPS.
The source code of this site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/linuskmr/linu.sk); pull requests are welcome!

*None of this information (should) reveal sensitive details that couldn't also be gathered otherwise, e.g. by using a [gelocation IP lookup](https://www.iplocation.net/ip-lookup), inspecting the `Server` HTTP header, or by using the [DevTools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) in general.*
