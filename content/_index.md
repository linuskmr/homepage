Hey, I'm Linus. I have been fascinated by computers and programming languages since learning Python 2 as a child. Since then I came across various programming languages, with Rust being my current favorite. In the field of computer science, I'm particularly interested in the intersection of operating systems, low-level systems programming using modern programming languages (especially Rust), networking as well as applied cybersecurity.
